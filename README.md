# ANN-GC-Toolbox
The Matlab toolbox allows to train and Artificial Neural Network with one
input layer and one output used for the solution of linear regression problems
through Stochastic gradient descent l1 algorithm (SGD-l1). Then by exploiting
the state (SS) models it is possible to compute conditional and unconditional
Granger causality (GC) [1]-[2]-[3].

The code is provided free of charge. It is neither exhaustively tested nor par-
ticularly well documented. The authors accept no liability for its use. Use,
modification and redistribution of the code is allowed in any way users see fit.
Authors ask only that authorship is acknowledged and ref. [1]-[2] is cited upon
utilization of the code in integral or partial form.To get started, we recommend
that you run and work through the two demonstration scripts.
